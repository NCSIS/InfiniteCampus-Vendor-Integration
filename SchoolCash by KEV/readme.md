Files should be tab delimited (→) with each line of text separated by a “return” (i.e. Each student record should be on its
own line). If a field is not to be included/recorded from the fields listed below (or listed as ‘Reserved’) leave a
tab/placeholder (→) in place. Reserved fields will be considered for future development.
