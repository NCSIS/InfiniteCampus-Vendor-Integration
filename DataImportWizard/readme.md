Infinite Campus provides the ability to import certain things into the system automatically.

Staff Email Addresses
Student Email Addresses

In this folder are the file formats for the different types of data imports. To find the Data Import Wizard.
System Settings -> Data Utilities -> Data Import Wizard

** If you do not have this tool as an option inside your Infinite Campus please contact your IC support team and they can enable it. 

I have created a powershell script that will convert the TIMS data into IC format.  This can be found here
